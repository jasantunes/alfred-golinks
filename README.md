<a id="download"></a>
Download
--------

Get StackExchange for Alfred from [GitHub releases][gh-releases].


<a id="usage"></a>
Usage
-----

The main action (keyword `stack`) shows a list of all StackExchange
sites. Choose one to search it.

There is also a search for StackOverflow.com configured (keyword
`.so`), but it is easy to add searches for your own favourite
StackExchange sites.

- `stack [<query>]` — Choose a StackExchange site to search.
    - `↩` — Select site
    - `⌘↩` — Set as default site
    - `⌥↩` — Reveal site icon in Finder
    - `⌘C` — Copy site ID to clipboard (for adding Script Filters)
- `.so <query>` — Search StackOverflow.com for `<query>`.
    See below for syntax.
    - `↩` or ` ⌘+NUM` — Open result in default browser
    - `⌘L` — Show full question title in Alfred's Large Text window


<a id="query-syntax"></a>
Query syntax
------------

Prefix a word in your `<query>` with `.` (full stop) to indicate that
it's a tag, e.g `requests .python` will search for answers tagged
`python` with the query `requests`.


<a id="results"></a>
Results
-------

Answered questions will be shown first in the list of results (and have
a green check mark on their icon).


<a id="adding-custom-searches"></a>
Adding custom searches
----------------------

You can easily add your own searches for specific sites by adding your
own Script Filter with the following Script:

```bash
/usr/bin/python go.py search --site <siteid> "$1"
```

The easiest way to do this is to make and edit a copy of the built-in
StackOverflow.com search.

To get a site ID, use the site search (keyword `stack`) and hit `⌘C` on
the desired site to copy its ID to the clipboard.

You can also use `⌥↩` on a site to reveal its icon in Finder.
